# Kleborate tests

Kleborate comes with a few automated tests to help with development and spotting bugs. Most users don't need to worry about these, but you're welcome to run the tests if you want! To do so, you'll need [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) installed.

To run the tests, execute this command from Kleborate's root directory (i.e the directory which contains `kleborate-runner.py`):
```
python3 -m pytest
```
