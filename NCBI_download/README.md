# NCBI Pathogen Detection downloader

[ncbi_klebs_pathogen_downloader.py] is a script to download all _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ assemblies from [NCBI Pathogen Detection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/) and run Kleborate on them. The assemblies are saved in `*.fna.gz` files (as they are on NCBI) and the data table contains both NCBI's metadata as well as Kleborate's results.
